# stack

```xs
stack {
  var $counter {
    value = 0
  }
  for (3) {
    each as $index {
      math.add $counter {
        value = 1
      }
    }
  }
  debug.log {
    value = $counter
  }
}
```

A `stack` block defines a sequence of actions to be executed in a specific context, such as within a `query`, `function`, `task`, or other block (e.g., `group`, `transaction`). It acts as a container for operations like:

- Variable declarations (e.g., `var`),
- Control flow (e.g., `for`, `conditional`),
- Function calls (e.g., `math.add`, `debug.log`),
- Database operations (e.g., `db.query`).

Stacks are used to organize and execute a series of steps in a structured manner, often as part of a larger workflow.

# input

```xs
input {
  text username filters=trim {
    description = "User's login name"
    sensitive = false
  }
  int age? {
    description = "User's age (optional)"
  }
}
```

An `input` block defines the parameters expected by a `query` or `function`. It includes:

- Fields with their data types (e.g., `text`, `int`),
- Optional status (marked with `?`),
- Filters (e.g., `trim`) to process the input,
- Metadata like `description` for clarity or `sensitive` to mark private data.

Inputs specify the data that a query or function can receive and work with, such as user-provided values in an API request.

# schema

```xs
schema {
  int customer_id
  text full_name filters=trim {
    description = "Customer's full name"
  }
  email contact_email filters=trim|lower {
    description = "Customer's email address"
    sensitive = true
  }
  timestamp registered_at?=now
}
```

A `schema` block, used within a `table` file, defines the structure of a database table. It includes:

- Fields with their data types (e.g., `int`, `text`, `email`),
- Optional status (marked with `?`),
- Default values (e.g., `?=now`),
- Filters (e.g., `trim|lower`) to process field values,
- Metadata like `description` for clarity or `sensitive` to mark private fields.

Schemas outline the columns and their properties for storing data in a table.

# response

```xs
response = $user_data
```

A `response` block, used within a `query` or `function`, specifies the data to return as the result of the operation. The value defines the output, which can be a variable (e.g., `$user_data`), a literal, or an expression. Responses determine what data is sent back to the caller, such as API response data or a functionâ€™s return value.

# schedule

```xs
schedule {
  events = [
    {starts_on: 2025-01-01 09:00:00+0000, freq: 86400},
    {starts_on: 2025-01-02 09:00:00+0000, freq: 604800, ends_on: 2025-12-31 09:00:00+0000}
  ]
}
```

A `schedule` block, used within a `task` file, defines when the task should run. It includes an `events` array with:

- `starts_on`: The start date and time (e.g., `2025-01-01 09:00:00+0000`),
- `freq`: The frequency in seconds for recurring tasks (e.g., `86400` for daily, `604800` for weekly),
- `ends_on`: An optional end date for recurring tasks (e.g., `2025-12-31 09:00:00+0000`).

Schedules automate task execution at specified intervals or times.

# table

```xs
table customer {
  auth = true
  security {
    guid = "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
  }
  schema {
    int id
    text name filters=trim {
      description = "Customer's full name"
    }
    email email filters=trim|lower {
      description = "Customer's email address"
      sensitive = true
    }
    timestamp signup_date?=now
    bool is_active?=true
  }
  index = [
    {type: "primary", field: [{name: "id"}]}
    {type: "gin", field: [{name: "xdo", op: "jsonb_path_op"}]}
    {type: "btree", field: [{name: "email", op: "desc"}]}
  ]
}
```

A `table` file defines the schema for a database table (e.g., `customer`). It includes:

- An `auth` flag to enable/disable authentication for the table,
- A `security` block with a `guid` for access control,
- A `schema` block listing fields with their data types (e.g., `int`, `text`, `email`), optional status (marked with `?`), default values (e.g., `?=now`), filters (e.g., `trim|lower`), and metadata like `description` or `sensitive`,
- An `index` block defining indexes for efficient querying (e.g., `primary` for the `id` field, `unique` for the `email` field).

Tables are used to structure and store data in a database, such as customer information.

# query

```xs
query products verb=GET {
  input {
    text category filters=trim {
      description = "Product category to filter by"
      sensitive = false
    }
  }
  stack {
    var $category_filter {
      value = $input.category
    }
    conditional {
      if ($category_filter|strlen > 0) {
        db.query product {
          where = ($db.product.category|to_lower) == ($category_filter|to_lower)
        } as $filtered_products
      }
      else {
        db.query product {
        } as $filtered_products
      }
    }
  }
  response = $filtered_products
}
```

A `query` file defines an API endpoint to handle HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST). It includes:

- A path (e.g., `/products`) and HTTP method (`verb`),
- An `input` block to define request parameters (e.g., `category`), which can have filters (e.g., `trim`) and metadata like `description` or `sensitive`,
- A `stack` block containing the logic to process the request (e.g., querying a database, applying conditions),
- A `response` block specifying the data to return (e.g., `$filtered_products`).

Queries are essential for creating API endpoints to retrieve or manipulate data, such as fetching products by category.

# workflow_test

```xs
workflow_test test_sum_api {
  description = "Test the sum API"

  stack {
    api.call sum verb=GET {
      api_group = "new api"
      headers = ""
      input = {a: 22, b: 33}
    } as $sum
  }
}
```

A workflow_test is a way to check if different parts of your Xano project (like APIs, functions, or tasks) work together correctly. It lets you run these parts with specific inputs and compare the results to what you expect, ensuring everything functions as intended.

# api_group

```xs
api_group "another api" {
  description = "Some description"
  active = false
  canonical = "HZ4jLtdc"
  swagger = true
  tags = ["foo", "bar"]
}
```

An `api_group` file defines the rules applied to the API endpoint (`query`) it contains.

- `description`: A brief explanation of the API group.
- `active`: A flag indicating whether the API endpoints inside this API group are active or not.
- `canonical`: A unique identifier for the API group, will be used in as part of the URL of each endpoint.
- `swagger`: A flag indicating whether the API group is documented in Swagger.
- `tags`: An array of tags associated with the API group.

# function

```xs
function maths/calculate_total {
  input {
    int quantity?
    int price_per_item?
  }
  stack {
    var $total {
      value = 0
    }
    conditional {
      if ($input.quantity == null || $input.price_per_item == null) {
        throw {
          name = "InvalidInputError"
          value = "Quantity and price must be provided"
        }
      }
      else {
        math.mul $total {
          value = $input.quantity
        }
        math.mul $total {
          value = $input.price_per_item
        }
      }
    }
  }
  response = $total
}
```

A `function` file defines a reusable custom function that can be called elsewhere in your script. It includes:

- A name (e.g., `"calculate_total"`) to identify the function,
- An `input` block to define parameters (e.g., `quantity` and `price_per_item`), which can be optional (marked with `?`),
- A `stack` block containing the logic to execute (e.g., calculations, conditionals),
- A `response` block specifying the return value (e.g., `$total`).

Functions are ideal for encapsulating logic, such as calculating a total cost, that can be reused across scripts.

# task

```xs
task "daily_report" {
  stack {
    db.query sales {
      description = "Fetch daily sales data"
    } as $daily_sales
  }
  schedule {
    events = [
      {starts_on: 2025-01-01 08:00:00+0000, freq: 86400}
    ]
  }
}
```

A `task` file defines a scheduled job that runs automatically at specified times. It includes:

- A name (e.g., `"daily_report"`) to identify the task,
- A `stack` block containing the actions to execute (e.g., querying a database),
- A `schedule` block with `events` to define when the task runs, including:
  - `starts_on`: The start date and time (e.g., `2025-01-01 08:00:00+0000`),
  - `freq`: The frequency in seconds for recurring tasks (e.g., `86400` for daily),
  - `ends_on`: An optional end date for recurring tasks (not used here).

Tasks are ideal for automating recurring operations like generating reports or syncing data.

# task.call

  api_group = "account"
  headers = []|push:"Authorization: Bearer token123"
  input = {
    name: "New Name"
  }
} as $account_update_response
```

Calls an internal Xano API endpoint, it allows you to invoke internal APIs within your end-to-end workflows tests.

- `api.call` signature is similar to the `query` definition it's invoking (e.g., `query <URL> verb=<METHOD> {...}`).
- `api_group`: The API group to which the endpoint belongs.
- `headers`: Custom headers to include in the request.
- `input`: The request payload.

# api.lambda

```xs
api.lambda {
  code = """
    // Javascript or Typescript code here
    return $input.value > 10 ? true : false;
    """
  timeout = 10
} as $result
```

allows you to run provided `code` in Javascript or Typescript in a sandboxed environment. Maximum execution time is `timeout` seconds.

The lambda function has access to your function stack context like `$input`, `$var`, `$auth` and `$env`.

The result of the execution is stored in `as $result` variable and is the returned value of the code.

# api.request

```xs
api.request {
  url = "https://api.example.com/users"

Below is the documentation for the XanoScript functions related to database operations and control flow, as requested in your query. Each entry follows the style of the existing documentation, providing a code snippet example and a brief explanation of what the function does. The examples use meaningful variable names to illustrate practical use cases.

# conditional

```xs
conditional {
  if ($user_age > 18) {
    debug.log {
      value = "Adult user"
    }
  }
  elseif ($user_age < 18) {
    debug.log {
      value = "Minor user"
    }
  }
  else {
    debug.log {
      value = "User age not specified"
    }
  }
}
```

Controls the flow of the script based on specified conditions, allowing different code blocks to execute depending on whether the conditions are true or false. It functions like an if-else statement, checking each condition in sequence and running the corresponding block.

# continue

```xs
foreach $users as $user {
  if ($user.age < 18) {
    continue
  }
  debug.log {
    value = $user.name ~ " is an adult"
  }
}
```

Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one. This is useful for bypassing specific items in a loop based on a condition, such as skipping users under 18 in this example.

# db.add

```xs
db.add user {
  data = {
    name: $input.name,
    email: $input.email
  }
} as $new_user
```

Inserts a new record into a specified database table (e.g., `user`) with the provided data fields. The new record is stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$new_user`, for further use.

# db.add_or_edit

```xs
db.add_or_edit user {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
  data = {
    name: $input.name,
    category: $input.category
  }
} as $user_record
```

Inserts a new record into a database table (e.g., `user`) or updates an existing one based on a specified field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). The data block specifies the fields to add or update, and the resulting record is stored in `$user_record`.

# db.del

```xs
db.del comment {
  field_name = "id"
  field_value = $input.commentId
}
```

Removes a record from a database table (e.g., `comment`) based on a specified field (e.g., `id`) and its value (e.g., `$input.commentId`). This deletes the matching record.

# db.direct_query

```xs
db.direct_query {
  code = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE users.email = ?"
  response_type = "list"
  arg = $input.email
} as $query_results
```

# db.edit

```xs
db.edit user {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
  data = {
    category: $input.category
  }
} as $updated_user
```

# db.patch

```xs
db.patch user {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
  data = {
    category: $input.category
  }
} as $updated_user
```

Updates specific fields of an existing record in a database table (e.g., `user`) identified by a field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). The `data` block specifies the fields to update, and the modified record is stored in `$updated_user`.

# db.get

```xs
db.get user {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
} as $user
```

Retrieves a single record from a database table (e.g., `user`) based on a specified field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). The fetched record is stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$user`.

# db.has

```xs
db.has user {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
} as $user_exists
```

# db.query

```xs
db.query client {
  description = "Fetch client details by name"
  where = $db.client.name ilike $input.search

      totals  : true
      offset  : 0
      metadata: true
    }
  }
  sort: {"client.name": "asc"}

} as $matched_client
```

Retrieves multiple records from a database table (e.g., `user`) based on a search condition. Here, it matches records where the lowercase email equals the lowercase input email. The results are stored in `$users`.

# db.schema

```xs
db.schema user {
  path = "email"
} as $email_schema
```

Returns the schema of a database table (e.g., `user`) or a specific field within it (e.g., `email` via `path`). The schema information is stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$email_schema`.

# db.set_datasource

```xs
db.set_datasource {
  value = "test"
}
```

Changes the datasource for all subsequent database queries in the current script execution to the specified value (e.g., `"test"`). This affects all database operations that follow.

# db.transaction

```xs
db.transaction {
  description = "Update user and log action"
  stack {
    db.update user { /* ... */ }
    db.add log { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

Executes a series of database operations (e.g., updating a user and adding a log entry) within a single transaction. Ensures atomicityâ€”either all operations succeed, or none are applied. The `description` provides context.

# db.truncate

```xs
db.truncate user {
  reset = true
}
```

Deletes all records from a specified database table (e.g., `user`). If `reset = true`, it also resets any auto-incrementing IDs, effectively clearing the table and starting fresh.

# db.external.mssql.direct_query

```xs
db.external.mssql.direct_query {
  code = "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orders.total > ?"
  response_type = "list"
  connection_string = "mssql://db_user:db_password@server.com:1433/sales_db?sslmode=disabled"
  arg = $input.min_total
} as $large_orders
```

Executes a SQL query directly on an external Microsoft SQL Server database. The `code` parameter contains the SQL statement, and `response_type` specifies whether it returns a `list` of records or a `single` record. The `connection_string` provides access to the database, and `arg` supplies values for placeholders (e.g., `?`) in the query. Results are stored in the variable defined by `as`, here `$large_orders`.

# db.external.mysql.direct_query

```xs
db.external.mysql.direct_query {
  code = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE products.category = ?"
  response_type = "list"
  connection_string = "mysql://db_user:db_password@host.com:3306/inventory_db?sslmode=disabled"
  arg = $input.category
} as $category_products
```

Runs a SQL query directly on an external MySQL database. The `response_type` determines if the result is a `list` or a `single` record. The `connection_string` specifies the database connection, and `arg` provides values for query placeholders. The output is stored in the `as` variable, here `$category_products`.

# db.external.oracle.direct_query

```xs

# debug.stop

```xs
debug.stop {
  value = $some_var
}
```

This function stops the scriptâ€™s execution at the point where itâ€™s called and sends the specified `value` to the debugger. Itâ€™s a handy tool for troubleshooting, allowing you to inspect the contents of a variable (like `$some_var`) during development to ensure your script is working as expected.

# foreach

```xs
foreach ($numbers_list) {
  each as $item {
    var.update $sum {
      value = $sum + $item
    }
  }
}
```

**Example with a predefined list**:

```xs
foreach ([1, 2, 3, 4]) {
  each as $item {
    var.update $sum {
      value = $sum + $item
    }
  }
}
```

The `foreach` function loops through every item in a list (e.g., an array like `$numbers_list` or `[1, 2, 3, 4]`). The `each as` clause assigns the current item to a variable (e.g., `$item`), which you can use inside the loop to perform actions on each element.

# for

```xs
for (10) {
  description = "Repeat this 10 times, with $index counting from 0 to 9"
  each as $index {
    debug.log {
      value = $index + 1
    }
  }
}
```

This function creates a loop that runs a set number of times (e.g., 10). The `each as` clause provides a counter variable (e.g., `$index`), which starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, up to one less than the specified number (e.g., 0 through 9 for a count of 10).

# function.run

```xs
function.run add_fn {
  input = { a: $input.a, b: $input.b }
} as $func_result
```

The `function.run` function calls a custom function (e.g., `add_fn`) and passes it the data specified in the `input` parameter (e.g., an object with `a` and `b` values). The result of the function is stored in the variable named after `as` (e.g., `$func_result`), making it available for further use in your script.

# group

```xs
group {
  description = "your group description"
  stack {
    debug.log {
      value = "Action 1"
    }
  }
}
```

The `group` function organizes a set of actions into a logical block that can be collapsed in the user interface for better readability. The `description` field labels the group (e.g., "group description"), and the `stack` contains the actions you want to group together.

```xs
math.sub $total_cost {
  value = $discount_amount
}
```

Subtracts the specified `value` (e.g., `$discount_amount`) from the variable (e.g., `$total_cost`) and updates the variable with the result. This is ideal for scenarios like reducing a total by a discount.

**NOTE**: math.sub does not return a value; it mutates the variable directly.

```xs
math.mul $base_price {
  value = $tax_rate
}
```

Multiplies the variable (e.g., `$base_price`) by the specified `value` (e.g., `$tax_rate`) and stores the product back into the variable. Use this to calculate values like a price with tax applied.

**NOTE**: math.mul does not return a value; it mutates the variable directly.

```xs
math.div $total_time {
  value = $num_tasks
}
```

Divides the variable (e.g., `$total_time`) by the specified `value` (e.g., `$num_tasks`), updating the variable with the quotient. This is useful for finding averages, such as time per task.

**NOTE**: math.div mutates the value, it doesn't have a return value.

# math.bitwise.xor

```xs
math.bitwise.xor $flags {
  value = $toggle_bit
}
```

Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable (e.g., `$flags`) and the specified `value` (e.g., `$toggle_bit`), storing the result in the variable. This is handy for toggling specific bits in a binary flag.

**NOTE**: math.bitwise.xor mutates the value, it doesn't have a return value.

# math.bitwise.or

```xs
math.bitwise.or $permissions {
  value = $new_permission
}
```

Applies a bitwise OR operation between the variable (e.g., `$permissions`) and the specified `value` (e.g., `$new_permission`), updating the variable with the result. Commonly used to add permissions to an existing set.

**NOTE**: math.bitwise.or mutates the value, it doesn't have a return value.

# math.bitwise.and

```xs
math.bitwise.and $status_flags {
  value = $check_bit
}
```

Executes a bitwise AND operation between the variable (e.g., `$status_flags`) and the specified `value` (e.g., `$check_bit`), saving the result in the variable. This is useful for checking if a particular bit is set.

**NOTE**: math.bitwise.and mutates the value, it doesn't have a return value.

# math.add

```xs
math.add $cart_total {
  value = $item_price
}
```

Adds the specified `value` (e.g., `$item_price`) to the variable (e.g., `$cart_total`) and updates the variable with the sum. Perfect for accumulating values, like adding an itemâ€™s cost to a cart total.

**NOTE**: math.add mutates the value, it doesn't have a return value.

# $input

```xs
$input.user_id
```

The `$input` variable provides access to all input parameters sent to the scriptâ€™s context. It is an object containing key-value pairs representing the input data, which can be accessed and manipulated within the script.

# $env

The `$env` variable allows access to environment variables defined within your workspace. These variables can store sensitive information like API keys or configuration settings, which can be referenced securely within your script.

Xano also defines a series of default environment variables for you to use within your functions:

- `$env.$remote_ip`: resolves to the IP address of the individual accessing the API endpoint.
- `$env.$http_headers`: this is a text array of headers that are sent to the API endpoint.
- `$env.$api_baseurl`: contains the base URL of the active endpoint.
- `$env.$request_uri`: contains the URI that is being accessed from the API.
- `$env.$request_method`: this is the method (GET, POST, DELETE, etc) of the incoming API request.
- `$env.$request_querystring`: contains the query string of the URI that is being accessed from the API.
- `$env.$request_auth_token`: contains the authorization token of the API request.
- `$env.$datasource`: contains which datasource is being used.
- `$env.$branch`: contains which branch is being used.

# $error

The `$error` variable only exists within the `catch` of a `try_catch` block and provides details about the most recent error that occurred within a `try` block. It contains properties such as `code`, `message`, `name`, and `result`, which can be used for error handling and logging purposes.

```xs
try_catch {
  try {
    function.run some_function {
      input = { param: "value" }
    }
  }
  catch {
    var.update $my_error {
      code = $error.code
      message = $error.message
      name = $error.name
      result = $error.result
    }
  }
}
```

# $var

The `$var` variable provides access to all user-defined variables within the script. `$var` can also be accessed through their short form (e.g., `$counter`) so long that these do not conflict with reserved keywords (`$input`, `$env`, `$error`...).

You may use `var.update` to modify the value of a variable during script execution.

```xs
var $counter {
  value = 1
}

var.update $counter {
  value = $var.counter + 1
}
```
