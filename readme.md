# XanoScript Extension for Visual Studio Code

**Build secure, scalable backends at lightning speed – right in VS Code or Cursor.**

XanoScript brings the power of Xano's no-code backend platform into your favorite code editor. Write and deploy APIs, functions, and database interactions with unprecedented speed and security. No more context-switching between tools – develop, stage, push, and collaborate seamlessly in one place. Whether you're a solo dev or part of a team, XanoScript supercharges your workflow to ship production-ready backends in minutes, not days.

## Why XanoScript? Get Excited About Rapid, Secure Development

Imagine hovering over code for instant insights, generating full CRUD endpoints with a single command, staging changes with diff views, and pushing to Xano in one click – all while an AI copilot helps you code smarter. XanoScript makes backend development fast, intuitive, and secure by design:

- **Blazing-Fast Iteration**: Prototype and deploy APIs without leaving your editor. Secure auth, data validation, and encryption are built-in, so you focus on features, not boilerplate.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Automatic handling of auth tokens, password hashing, and access controls ensures your apps are secure from day one.
- **AI-Powered Productivity**: Let the copilot suggest code, fix bugs, and optimize logic on the fly.
- **Seamless Xano Integration**: Sync your local files with Xano's cloud – every API endpoint, function, or table becomes a manageable file in your workspace.

Ready to 10x your backend speed? Let's dive in.

Plus, core features to make coding a breeze:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Vibrant, consistent coloring for XanoScript files (.xs).
- **Code Completion**: Context-aware suggestions as you type.
- **Error Checking and Linting**: Real-time detection to catch issues early.
- **Full Integration**: Native support for Xano's database queries, API calls, and security functions.

## Design Philosophy

XanoScript treats every Xano object (API endpoints, groups, functions, tables) as a local file. The extension syncs these with your Xano workspace, organizing them into a clean folder structure for easy navigation and version control.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code (or Cursor).
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X).
3. Search for "XanoScript" and hit Install.

Or grab the .vsix from our [Extension's page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xano.xanoscript) for manual install.

## Usage

Open a .xs file, and you're off! Connect to your Xano account via the extension settings, then start building.

Quick example: a simple "Hello, World!" API endpoint.

```xanoscript
query hello_world verb=GET {
  description = "Returns a personalized hello world message."

  input {
    text name filters=trim {
      description = "Name of the person to greet."
    }
  }

  stack {
    var $message {
      value = "Hello, " ~ $input.name ~ "! Welcome to the world of Xano."
    }
  }

  response = {
    message: $message
  }

  history = 100
}
```
